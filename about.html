                <p>This project was a way for me to attempt to build an application for the first time on my own using an API. For this project I am using MLB Data API to aquire up-to-date current baseball stats. As this is an API, any information that I aquire will be relevant as long as the API continues to provide updated stats. I am a currently teaching myself programming with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project includes CSS with SASS but no styling frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize (That is for a different project). There is also no React or any sort of JavaScript framework (that is also for a different project). With this app, I hope to better understand APIs, asynchronous JavaScript, and the benefits of Sass.</p>

                <h4>The Current State</h4>
                <p>The current state of this project is not completed. As of this update I have the pitching staff on the Minnesota Twins (my home team). The table includes some basic information about each pitcher and the ERA is color coded depending on their stat, with green being good and red being bad. As this is the Twins, it seems to be more red than green lately. The next list item that I plan to complete next is to allow you to click on a player which will create a modal, showing more advanced stats on the selected player as well as giving an option to perform a YouTube search on that player for highlights.</p>
